        <div class="subheading mb-5">English Major üè´
        <p class="lead mb-4">Paulina Herrera is a current second year english major at the University of California Riverside. She is passionate when it comes to academia and especially in the dissemination of knowledge. Paulina hopes to pursue higher education and later on obtain a job within the university field as a professor. Currently, she offers her services as a writing tutor for fellow students as well as highschool students, and is also a freelance editor. Paulina began her journey through volunteer work at her local elementary schools. During highschool she volunteered at the A.L.L. Program, for two years, in which she created lesson plans and helped children with homework. She was also in charge of conversing with parents and communicating the child's progress in their schoolwork and grades. This helped her realize the importance and impact education has on people's day to day lives. Her goal is to enable others to learn more and seek out academic opportunities, she believes this can be done by making learning interesting. Her goal is to make education accessible and enjoyable for future generations.
 <br><br>

During the same time Paulina was volunteering she also began a job as a tutor and translator, for a child with language disabilities at Richstone. She learned to be patient and the protocol for how one should go about teaching children with disabilities. She also learned the importance of taking into consideration the client and how they feel as well. Paulina was able to learn how to adapt her teaching style depending on the person. She also was able to use her ability to speak spanish as a bridge between her employer and the parents of the child. Her journey as a language tutor and translator lasted for three years and she has continued to maintain a good relationship with her employer and her client. After entering university Paulina continued her journey in education by volunteering at her alma mater for the AP English Literature class. There she honed her editing and critical skills when it came to writing while also helping others.
